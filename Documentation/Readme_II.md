## Goal
In this notebook I try to **clarify hypotheses and objectives** for the project.  
I use visualizations to explore the data and propose a first tentative explanation based on the results.

---

## This notebook
- State questions and hypotheses.  
- Explore the dataset with simple visualizations:
  - Distribution of positive, neutral, and negative comments.   
  - Relation between budget and positive ratio.  
- From the graphs, write **tentative insights**, e.g. genres with more positive comments, budget not linked to favorability.  
- Propose possible supervised learning models for the next step.  


## Deliverables
- **AnalysisYoutubeTrailer_II.ipynb** â†’ notebook with cleaned dataset, EDA results, and visualizations.
- **processed dataset** â†’ stored in `data/processed/` for reuse in Part III.

## Next step
Move on to **Part III**: feature selection and machine learning modeling.

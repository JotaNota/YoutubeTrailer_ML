# 🎬 YoutubeTrailer_ML – Final Project

## 📌 About this repository  
- This is a project that analyzes **YouTube movie trailers** using exploratory data analysis and machine learning.  
- The objective of this project is to apply data analysis and machine learning tools as part of a course assignment. The resulting model and insights are intended purely for academic and practical learning purposes.

The workflow includes:  
1. **EDA** - understanding the dataset.  
2. **Data cleaning and consolidation** - clarifying hypotheses.  
3. **Feature selection & machine learning** - predictive modeling.

## 📌 Dataset  

- **Dataset:** `movies_youtube_sentiments.csv`  
- **Link:** [Kaggle – Movies YouTube Trailers and Sentiment](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dineshvasired/movies-youtube-trailers-and-sentimentdinesh-dinesh)  
- **Size:** - 5,000 rows, 10+ columns   
- **Main variables:**  
  - `genre` → movie genre  
  - `rating` → movie rating (e.g., PG-13, R)  
  - `budget` → production budget (USD)  
  - `positive`, `neutral`, `negative` → sentiment counts from YouTube comments

## 📌 Project Stages  

###  Part I – Data Exploration  
- Inspected dataset structure, missing values, and duplicates.  
- Performed visualizations: **genre distribution**, **ratings**, and **sentiment counts**.  

### Part II – Consolidation and Hypotheses  
- Cleaned dataset and stored it in `processed/`.  
- Defined research questions and hypotheses.  
- Explored relationships between sentiment ratios, budget, and genres.  
- Proposed possible supervised models.  

### Part III – Feature Selection & ML Model  
- Constructed the favorability_level variable from positive, neutral, and negative comments, with neutral comments weighted at 25% to reflect partial impact. 
- Applied feature selection using `SelectKBest`, chi2.  
- Trained classification model using `favorability_level` as target.  
- Evaluated model with accuracy and confusion matrix.  
- Conclusions.

## 📌 Results  

- In the initial EDA, variables such as **genre** and **budget** were explored to build context and hypotheses.  
- After applying **dimensionality reduction**, other dataset features proved to be more relevant predictors.  
- Three classifiers were trained: **Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest**.  
- The classification model achieved **~70–75% accuracy** in predicting trailer favorability.  
- Feature selection improved interpretability by highlighting the **10 most predictive variables**.  
- **Random Forest** achieved the best performance, with a balanced trade-off between precision and recall, and an **accuracy close to 80%**.  
- The project served as a **practical exercise** in feature selection, model training, and evaluation, with results intended for academic purposes only.
